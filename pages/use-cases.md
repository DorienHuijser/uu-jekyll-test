## What?
In order to develop solutions that can be of practical use to multiple research projects, we are taking on several use cases. Use cases, in our case, are examples of research projects that need help tackling a privacy-related issue. The desired solution can be of any type, from deidentification workflows and agreement templates to software solutions for secure data sharing or pseudonymization. Importantly, the to be developed solution should be reusable for other projects, so the project should not fall within a niche research area or problem.

## Why?
By taking on use cases, we:
- Help researchers with common privacy-related needs AND
- Create a reusable solution for other researchers and data supporters to use in the future

## Have a use case you need help with?
Feel free to [contact us](contact), so we can see whether and how we can help you. Criteria for a suitable use case are:
- The case includes personal research data.
- A solution for de-identification or working safely with personal data is required, for example: pseudonymization, encryption, workflows, templates, synthetic data, federated analysis, etc.
- The solution can be used for other projects.
- The case falls within the timeframe of the Data Privacy Project: between now and January 2023.
